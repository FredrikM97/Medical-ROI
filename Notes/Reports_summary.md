# A Deep Learning Model to Predict a Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease by Using 18F-FDG PET of the Brain
## Summary: 
* By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer dis-ease achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of  75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis.
* Substantial work in the area of computer-aided diagnosis and risk classification has been performed by using structural imaging of the brain. But less work has been devoted to  applying  deep  learning  methods  to  functional  imaging  alone to classify patients with symptoms of dementia.
* Deep learning algorithm apparently utilized the whole brain with varying degrees of influence from various anatomic areas to make its final decision
* Good to use for comparison with other results
## Techniques
* Predictions based on holistic features of the imaging study
## Limitations: 
* Many limitations in report
## Keywords: 
* Saliency Map, t-SNE, Inception V3 network, ROC curves,  ADNI hold-out test, F-FDG

# Identification of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’sdiseases through the analysis of FDG-PET imagesusing machine learning techniques
## Summary:
* fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
* In dept of Parkinson’s disease(PD),Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
* Parkinson’s  disease  (PD): loss of dopamineproducing  nerve  cells  that  emanate  from  the  substantia  nigra  pars  compacta  in  the  midbrain,  and  project  to  the  striatum(putamen and caudate nucleus), that regulate movement
* Alzheimer’s disease (AD): Progressive, accumulative nerve celldeath and tissue loss throughout the brain, which over time shrinks dramatically
* Neuro degenerative disease: Difficult on clinical grounds only,  especially at anearly disease stage where there are overlapping features among some disease
* 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and Single Photon Emission ComputedTomography (SPECT) can be utilised to detect early decease before it is too late 
* Very good since it contains lot of info of AD, PD
* Lots of theoretical knowledge of methods
* Much text and a bit hard to follow when abridgement is used
## Techniques: 
* automated voxel-based statistical mapping, SSM/PCA, generalized matrix relevance LVQ (GMLVQ) , Leave-one-out  crossvalidation (LOOCV).
* Sensitivity, Specificity, AUC 
## Limitations: 

## Result
* Read CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK for result 

## Future work
* Interesting future line of work to project back the relevant characteristics from the feature space (subjectscores) to the voxel space (actual  image) in order to get insight into the  relevant patterns that distinguish the diseases.

## Keywords:
* Scaled subprofile model (SSM), Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ),Support Vector Machine (SVM), computer-aided  diagnosis, PDRP, ADRP, voxel space

# Metabolic Patterns across Core Features in Dementia with Lewy Bodies
## Summary
* Identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) clin-ical core features expression
* Normalization on the pons (seeFig 5B) resulted in greater sensitivity for regions with posi-tive weight, which were increased in number and extensionand included the vast majority of the bilateral frontolateral,posterior parietal, and temporolateral (although not medialtemporal) cortex as well as caudate nucleus on both hemi-spheres.
* Exploited the general DLB brain meta-bolic pattern into core-feature–specific patterns through the evaluation of the degree of covariance with the pres-ence of each core feature
* 4 core features
* pathophysiologyand clinical–imaging correlation in DLB, paving the pathtoward optimization of the use of FDG PET in this clinical setting
## Techniques
* Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance.
* Linear regression model to generatecore-feature–specific patterns
* Regression analysis to the locally normalized intensities
* spatially normalized scans were intensity-normalized with a whole-brain reference region (brain parenchyma with the exclu-sion of white matter and ventricles
* Gaussian filter
## Limitations
* Whole-brain intensity nor-malization may lead to reduced sensitivity for relative hypometabolic regions (especially given the variable range of disease severity of patients) and conversely, increased sensitivity to relative hypermetabolic regions
* autoptic confirmationwas not available
* Lots of limitations (p.10)
## Keywords 
* PCA, Cognitive fluctuations, gyrus, bilateral–parietal cortex, precuneus, volume of interest (VOI), ROI, MMSE-Sensitive Map (MMSE), Core Feature Scores, voxelwise correlation

# Quantifying brain metabolism from FDG-PET imagesinto a probability of Alzheimer's dementia score
## Summary
Aging–Alzheimer Association created three stages: preclinical DAT, mildcognitive impairment (MCI), and DAT
* Proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections that generates a probability score useful forinterpreting the FDG-PET images along the continuum of AD
* Concerns why external ROI and voxel-based images is not enough to give good predictions.
* Utilises the same dataset as we got
* Covers preprocess
* convolutional neural network is not rotation invariant
* Larger batchsize is memory intensive -> lower generalizability 
## Techniques
* saliency and class activation map, highlight the regions of the brain that are most impor-tant to the classification task
* left–right flip, rotation, and translation
* MRI-to-MNI space transformation
* ensemble by averaging the predictions from the 10 networks 
## Limitations
* complex spatiotemporal pattern of DAT-related abnormalities is not likely to be fully captured by measuring the intensities of a limited number of ROIs defined based on apriori assumptions (Fan, Resnick, Wu, & Davatzikos, 2008).
* statistical methods such as ttest (Arbizu et al., 2013). ROI-based and voxel-based approaches often require the use of individual MRI images tosuperimpose structural ROIs
* Further validation on an entirely inde-pendent clinical cohort is needed to verify that our model can handlescans obtained with different scanner parameters.
* limited prognostic value inpredicting future conversion to DAT using only an FDG-PET image.Improvements can come from incorporating other imaging modalitiesand clinical nonimaging data into this flexible framework
## Result
Network achieved 0.793AUC, 72.6% accuracy, 68.5% sensitivity, and 75.9% specificity on acompletely independent and unseen test set consisting of the uNC,sMCI, pNC, pMCI, and eDAT images.

# Diagnostic Performance of 18F-FDGPET/CT in Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases according to Published Meta-Analyses
* https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/3018349, 2019
* Status: Not useful

## Summary
* Focus on 18F-FDG PET/CT not 18F-FDG PET
* Aims to summarize the published evidence-based data about the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDGPET/CT in this setting.
* article demonstrates that there is increasingevidence about the diagnostic performance of18F-FDG PET/CT in infectious and inflammatory diseases, with good di-agnostic accuracy values for some indications (Table 1).

## Limitations
* 18F-FDG PET/CT may potentially be useful to direct therapeuticstrategies  improving  patient  outcome,  but  prospectiveoutcome studies are needed in this setting. In fact, diagnosticaccuracy of a test is not a measure of clinical effectiveness,and good diagnostic performance does not necessarily resultin improved patient outcomes.
* in somemeta-analyses, a limited number of published articles (someof them with small sample size) were included reducing thestatistical power of the analysis (Table 1).
