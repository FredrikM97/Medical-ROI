    "As some of you wanted to get more data from ADNI. I asked our team member who was responsible for downloading data from ADNI and pre-process them about the details for data preprocessing. He was very kind to share with me the steps and MATLAB scripts he used; you can find them attached.   The data preprocessing was done using Matlab and SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)"
