This folder contains two previous work to simplify the implementation. Due to no official repository was found the work was manually added to the project.


## ROIAlign implementation from pytorch framework
(https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/ops/roi_align.py on Nov 14 2019)

The work is done by **gregor** and adapted for 3D support without additional python function interface (only cpp function interface).
We take no credit for this part and refer to the previous work for a full implementation.
