* Evaluate if separate python script instead of SPM
* Limitations of matlab, one file at a time, can it handle multiple files?

## Question:
* Some folders contain 6 nii files. Should we keep them all if they are done on one test or select one of them?
* Should we mosaik one image as input or take each slice as an input?
* Each slice as one channel (replacement instead of color)?
